\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec-conclusions}

In this paper we have presented an ontological analysis of the GRADE taxonomy, originally proposed in~\cite{papatheocharous2015decision}. We believe that this work can be used as an initial discussion towards a more expressive version of The GRADE taxonomy, one that takes into consideration the ontological nature of the concepts and relations that exists between them. We argue that DMO and the work presented here are the first steps towards this goal.

As future work, we intend to dig deeper into this subject by analyzing the decision-making domain with the Ontology of Value and Risk~\cite{value-risk-2018}. We argue that Value and Risk are concepts that are intrinsically connected to the decision-making process, and should thus enrich and complement the concepts already considered in DMO.
